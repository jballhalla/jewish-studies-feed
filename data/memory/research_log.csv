10.1093/hgs/dcaf049,“Always One Step Ahead of the Germans…”: Escapes of Polish Jews from France to Spain During the Second World War,"Choińska, Dorota",Holocaust and Genocide Studies,Holo Geno Stud,8756-6583,,,,"Abstract This article examines the flight of Polish Jews from France to Spain in the last months of 1942. It draws on refugee files gathered in the Spanish archives and autobiographical accounts created by the survivors to explore three aspects leading to their illegal escape across the Pyrenees: first, the antisemitic persecution that these Polish Jews experienced in France; second, their strategies and decision-making process leading to eventual passage to Spain; and third, the various ways in which the refugees prepared for this endeavor. For most Polish Jews, the illegal border crossing to Spain was an option of last resort used only when they felt that remaining in France, even in hiding, put their lives in imminent danger. Although they had heard of or experienced firsthand various anti-Jewish measures introduced in France throughout the war, it was not until the latter half of 1942, after massive roundups and the full German occupation of France, that they eventually decided in favor of a clandestine escape to Spain. Even so, their flight was not spontaneous but well-thought-out and carefully planned. By analyzing Polish Jews’ decision to flee from France, this article sheds light on the patterns of behavior that Polish and other Eastern European Jews shared in the face of antisemitic persecution in Western Europe throughout the war.",https://doi.org/10.1093/hgs/dcaf049,2025-11-11T00:00:00,,2025-11-11T00:00:00,,journal-article,2025-11-14 06:09:49.495621

10.1007/s12397-025-09690-x,The Politics of Exception: Ex-Territoriality and the Meron Disaster,"Guzmen-Carmeli, Shlomo; Leon, Nissim",Contemporary Jewry,Contemp Jewry,0147-1694,45,4,,"Abstract In the aftermath of the Meron disaster, where 45 people lost their lives during a Lag BaOmer celebration, it became evident that the tragedy stemmed from that most Israeli of solutions: the art of managing intractable problems through strategic nonmanagement. The site where the disaster occurred, at the entrance to the Toldos Aharon Hasidic group’s ceremonial area, exemplifies how ultra-Orthodox communities navigate autonomy within Israel’s complex system of holy site management. This pattern reflects broader dynamics in Israeli society’s tendency to transform temporary improvisations into permanent institutions. The preservation of such arrangements has evolved from makeshift solutions to governance practice, particularly visible in contexts of religious significance, ethnic complexity, and contested sovereignty, from holy sites and Haredi communities to natural resources and border regions. Through examination of the Meron case alongside other instances of negotiated authority, this article demonstrates how ex-territorial arrangements in Israel serve not merely as practical responses to seemingly intractable conflicts, but as spaces where governance ambiguity becomes institutionalized. While these arrangements facilitate coexistence of competing claims, they simultaneously create regulatory vacuums where even basic safety considerations remain unaddressed. The Meron disaster thus illuminates not only the specific challenges of holy site management, but also the broader paradox of a modern state where the preservation of ambiguity has evolved into a characteristic mode of governance.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s12397-025-09690-x,2025-11-07T00:00:00,2025-12-01T00:00:00,2025-11-07T00:00:00,,journal-article,2025-11-14 06:09:44.271524

The survey, based on the EU Fundamental Rights Agency’s (FRA) questionnaire, gathered 334 responses—representing approximately 17–22% of Finland’s Jewish population over the age of 16. A significant majority of respondents reported a rise in antisemitism over the past 5 years, particularly in online spaces, media, and political discourse. The qualitative interviews not only confirmed these findings but also offered deeper insight into more subtle and complex manifestations of antisemitism, including ambient and implicit forms. Informants described the normalization of antisemitic tropes—especially in relation to criticism of Israel—as contributing to an atmosphere of discomfort, even when the expressions themselves were not overtly antisemitic. These expressions were often linked to discussions surrounding the war in Gaza and were predominantly associated with left-wing political narratives. The study highlights the persistence of both traditional and contemporary forms of antisemitism in Finland, indicating the need for further research and interventions to address this evolving issue.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s12397-025-09685-8,2025-10-31T00:00:00,2025-12-01T00:00:00,2025-10-31T00:00:00,,journal-article,2025-11-07 06:09:46.106985

10.1093/hgs/dcaf041,Those Who Stayed: Polish Jews Who Remained in the Soviet Union after the Second World War,"Edele, Mark; Riabichenko, Aleksandra; Goldlust, John",Holocaust and Genocide Studies,Holo Geno Stud,8756-6583,,,,"Abstract Of the 3.3 million Jews living in Poland in 1939, only 350,000 survived the Second World War. But of these, the majority—between 190,000 and 220,000—found sanctuary inside the USSR and thereby escaped becoming victims of the Nazi atrocities unleashed upon European Jewry between 1939 and 1945. After the war ended, most returned to Poland under the Soviet–Polish agreement on the repatriation of former Polish citizens from the USSR, and within a few years many had departed for Palestine, the United States, Canada, Australia, and other countries. Their diverse survival paths during the war and later postwar emigration and dispersal have been thoroughly explored in recent historiography. However, nothing has been written on those Polish Jews who, despite the opportunity for repatriation, remained in the Soviet Union. This article is the first to explore the wartime and postwar experiences of some of the Polish Jews who continued to reside in one of the Soviet republics. Qualitative analyses of thirty-three USC Shoah Foundation testimonies recorded with Jewish Holocaust survivors in the mid-1990s and early 2000s provide insights into the various reasons, circumstances, and contingencies that caused them to stay. This research goes beyond the experiences of the majority and focuses on the postwar life trajectories of the roughly 10 percent of Polish Jews who survived in the wartime USSR and then settled in Russia, Ukraine, and other Soviet republics and made their lives as Soviet citizens.",https://doi.org/10.1093/hgs/dcaf041,2025-10-28T00:00:00,,2025-10-28T00:00:00,,journal-article,2025-10-31 06:09:13.426989

10.1093/mj/kjaf014,THE “FAILURE OF SUCCESS” IN ENLIGHTENMENT THOUGHT: JONATHAN SACKS AS A JEWISH PHILOSOPHER,"Feldmann-Kaye, Miriam",Modern Judaism,Mod Judaism,1086-3273,,,,"ABSTRACT This article focuses on the Enlightenment and its implications for modern Jewish philosophy in the thought of Jonathan Sacks (1948–2020). It will examine how the philosophical ideas of Kant, Hegel, Voltaire, Nietzsche, and others led Sacks to take a position which claimed that the “abstract universalism” of Enlightenment thought had failed. The premise for this conclusion was rooted in the Shoah which he viewed in a philosophical sense as the culmination of the Enlightenment. That is, the “Final Solution” had not been prevented by modern values but, rather, had been propelled by aspects of Enlightenment thought. This essay analyzes the role that Spinoza played for Sacks as representative of a Jewish figure who contributed to Enlightenment values and thus complexified his claims. The discipline of “Modern Jewish thought”—discussed here in relation to Rabbis A. I. Kook and Samson Raphael Hirsch—presented challenges and required redefinition owing to Sacks’ relation to the Enlightenment. These challenges came in the form of postmodernism and the ethical relativism it entailed, and the quest to retain ethics as the first priority according to the views of Levinas and others. Thus, this essay brings Sacks into conversation with several other philosophers and Jewish thinkers and puts forward an original perspective on a new contribution to contemporary Jewish thought.",https://doi.org/10.1093/mj/kjaf014,2025-10-29T00:00:00,,2025-10-29T00:00:00,,journal-article,2025-10-31 06:08:57.720065

The study employs the “dwelling perspective,” suggesting locations acquire social meaning as symbols of those who lived there, creating powerful connections between place and collective memory. Masada represents ancient Jewish resistance and national liberty, becoming embedded in Zionist ideology; Polish death camps reinforce contemporary Jewish identity by demonstrating powerlessness consequences while strengthening connections to Israel as refuge; and Givat Hatachmoshet commemorates the 1967 Jerusalem battle, connecting visitors to recent Israeli military heroism. The central thesis argues that these pilgrimages facilitate fundamental transformation in Jewish identity—shifting from the “rabbinical Jew” characterized by defensive exile strategies toward reclaiming the “biblical Jew” embodying the offensive, assertive ethos of strength and self-determination. Through active engagement with these sites representing chronological progression from ancient resistance through modern victimization to contemporary empowerment, participants experience visceral connections to Jewish power and sovereignty rather than merely intellectual historical learning, demonstrating how physical spaces become crucial tools for reconstructing collective identity and cultural meaning.",https://doi.org/10.1093/mj/kjaf016,2025-10-29T00:00:00,,2025-10-29T00:00:00,,journal-article,2025-10-31 06:08:57.719995

They occupy a liminal “outsider within” position in their communities. Through analysis of four characters—Sharon Kahn’s Ruby Rothman (1998–2006), Rochelle Krich’s Molly Blume (2002–2005), Naomi Graetz’s Toby Kramer (2004), and Brenda Barrie’s Dan Goldin (2011), all rabbi’s-spouse sleuths—the article reveals how this innovative subgenre creates protagonists who navigate between insider knowledge and outsider perspective. Unlike conventional clerical detective fiction, these works feature characters who lack formal religious authority yet possess privileged community access. The protagonists of these novels employ distinct investigative approaches, from amateur detection to academic research methods. The subgenre’s emergence in early twenty-first century works, all by female authors, represents a significant literary innovation that challenges traditional representations of Jewish leadership and gender dynamics. By transforming the marginalized position of the rabbi’s spouse into a narrative advantage, these works create a unique literary space where questions of religious identity, gender equality, and cultural belonging can be explored through the accessible medium of mystery fiction.",https://doi.org/10.1093/mj/kjaf015,2025-10-29T00:00:00,,2025-10-29T00:00:00,,journal-article,2025-10-31 06:08:57.719922

                    <i>THE TALE OF A NIGGUN</i>","Reiser, Daniel",Modern Judaism,Mod Judaism,1086-3273,,,,"ABSTRACT This study examines Elie Wiesel’s overlooked poem “The Tale of a Niggun,” originally published in 1978 but forgotten until its republication in 2020. Through literary and historical analysis, the paper demonstrates how Wiesel artfully reconstructs the essence of Hasidism and the Hasidic Niggun, offering an innovative post-Holocaust perspective. The poem depicts a ghetto rabbi facing an impossible Nazi demand—to select ten Jews for hanging on Purim as revenge for Haman’s sons. During a spiritual odyssey, the rabbi encounters great Jewish figures—Maimonides, the Baal Shem Tov, the Vilna Gaon, and Rabbi Levi Yitzchak of Berditchev—ultimately choosing community solidarity over individual sacrifice. Historical research reveals the poem’s basis in actual 1942 executions in Nazi-occupied Poland. Wiesel redefines Hasidism as fundamentally communal rather than mystical, where unity transcends even life itself. The Hasidic Niggun becomes an eternal symbol oscillating between divine presence and absence, connecting survivors to Jewish tradition despite the rupture of the Holocaust. The study positions Wiesel as a crucial cultural agent transmitting both Holocaust memory and Hasidic legacy to future generations.",https://doi.org/10.1093/mj/kjaf018,2025-10-29T00:00:00,,2025-10-29T00:00:00,,journal-article,2025-10-31 06:08:57.719844

The article focuses on a key pillar of this paradigm shift in the official historical narrative promoted by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), namely, its “internationalization.” Whereas previously the official CCP-promoted historical reading of the Second World War focused on domestic resistance against Japanese aggression, in the “Xi Jinping Era,” the conflict discursively positions China in the role of a key and decisive actor of the “World Anti-Fascist War.” By focusing on two major state-run memorial museums in China—the Museum of the War of Chinese People's Resistance against Japanese Aggression and the Memorial Hall of the Victims in Nanjing Massacre by Japanese Invaders—the article unpacks key aspects of the shift toward internationalization by addressing China's rebranding of its historical role as one of the victorious Allies of the Second World War, instrumentalization of Holocaust history through a newly enforced emphasis on Shanghai as a wartime refuge, and engagement with transnational musealization strategies. Through a study of how these trends come into being in museum spaces, the article analyzes the internationalization of Second World War memory in the PRC as an inherent part of Xi Jinping's ambition to consolidate China as a global power, a leading member of the United Nations, and a moral force in the international community.",https://doi.org/10.1093/hgs/dcaf038,2025-10-15T00:00:00,,2025-10-15T00:00:00,,journal-article,2025-10-23 22:13:35.466694

10.1093/hgs/dcaf044,Mapping the Emotional Landscapes of the Holocaust: Visualizing Space and Place in Survivor Trajectories,"Cole, Tim; Giordano, Alberto",Holocaust and Genocide Studies,Holo Geno Stud,8756-6583,,,,"Abstract The “spatial turn” in Holocaust studies has led to renewed interest in mapping the Holocaust as both event and experience. This article explores experiments with more multifaceted—and “integrated” (per Saul Friedländer)—mapping of Holocaust space and place to include the emotional dimensions of spatial experience. Drawing on Agnew and Duncan's influential introduction of place as a triad that encompasses location, locale, and sense of place, we seek to map the Holocaust as a complex spatial experience. Agnew and Duncan's definition incorporates the idea of abstract space as it is understood in GIScience (location); the social, cultural, political, economic, and material dimensions of place (locale); and the behavioral and emotional component of place (sense of place). Drawing on a close reading of two Holocaust survivors’ narratives, we map their shifting experiences (over both and time and space) at different spatial scales with a particular focus on exploring the relationships between people, place, events, and emotions. The two survivors—Gilberto Salmoni and Gabor Somjen—represent trajectories at two different scales (the continental and city scale, respectively) and two different national contexts (Italy and Hungary) that went through several different locales, not only locations. The article offers a representational model that allows for comparative research of the Holocaust experience at the resolution of the individual that is scalable in two ways: It can include any number of testimonies, and it can graphically render the events and places of the Holocaust at multiple scales and for different spatiotemporal experiences. While critically assessing the limits of the model—specifically vis-à-vis representing emotions and sense of place—the article suggests the value of comparative cartographic analysis in understanding the shifting emotional landscapes of the Holocaust and the place-based nature of victim experience.",https://doi.org/10.1093/hgs/dcaf044,2025-10-22T00:00:00,,2025-10-22T00:00:00,,journal-article,2025-10-23 22:13:35.466594

Using feminist narrative analysis of qualitative interviews, we argue familial contexts serve as core formative spaces for constructing lived religion and sustaining young Mizrahi-Masorti Jewish-Israelis’ identities, often excluded from educational institutions and cultural frameworks. Our study reveals lived religion as an intergenerational process of sustaining practices, beliefs, and identities through the interplay of formal and informal, individual and collective, and intimate and political dimensions. By broadening and innovating the concepts of “relational spirituality” and a “theology of care,” we demonstrate how religious life emerges from dynamic divisions of “spiritual labor” within commitments to, and care for, familial networks. Centering prayer practices, we show how relationships with the divine are shaped in familial terms, expressed through flexible gendered roles and an ethic of care that carries cultural and political significance. It contributes to the study of lived religion by challenging its Western individualistic focus instead highlighting relational, collective, and marginalized dimensions. It also advances scholarship on relational spirituality by connecting micro-level familial practices with macro-level structures and histories, offering a qualitative empirical basis for theoretical insights illuminating the interconnectedness of religious practices, beliefs, and familial and sociocultural dynamics.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s12397-025-09670-1,2025-09-14T00:00:00,2025-09-01T00:00:00,2025-09-14T00:00:00,,journal-article,2025-09-19 02:16:55.056602
