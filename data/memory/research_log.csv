When the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp was liberated, even the most battle-hardened soldier was overwhelmed by the aftermath of the brutal crimes perpetrated in the camp, and many Allied personnel were angered to the point that they exacted violent reprisals on members of the Schutzstaffel (SS). Moreover, in the eyes of the liberators the behavior of the survivors was abnormal and illogical, and the sight and smell of them evoked feelings of disgust. Personnel often described the survivors using animal metaphors—a type of zoomorphic language. Liberators experienced a broad range of negative emotions, and yet their responses demonstrate similar patterns of thought, language, imagery, and metaphors. While each soldier presented their own perspective of the experience, there is a discernible overlap in what they documented.",https://doi.org/10.1093/hgs/dcaf062,2025-12-12T00:00:00,,2025-12-12T00:00:00,,journal-article,2025-12-19 06:09:55.771779

The present paper undertakes this analysis using the example of Birthright Israel. First, using latent class analysis, we develop a data-informed typology for classifying different religious and cultural childhood experiences of American Jewish young adults. We then examine the extent to which each group in the typology is impacted by participation in Birthright Israel, using an analytic approach that compares pre- and post-trip responses for both individuals who participated in Birthright Israel and a comparison group of those who applied but did not participate. We find that for some measures, Birthright Israel has a significant impact on participants with a variety of background experiences, while for other outcomes, Birthright Israel’s impact is concentrated among those with the least exposure to Jewish life.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s12397-025-09693-8,2025-12-18T00:00:00,2026-03-01T00:00:00,2025-12-18T00:00:00,,journal-article,2025-12-19 06:09:48.907822

10.1093/hgs/dcaf052,Emotions in Holocaust Studies: An Introduction,"Fischer, Stefanie; Kabalek, Kobi",Holocaust and Genocide Studies,Holo Geno Stud,8756-6583,,,,"Abstract To say that emotions play a central role in past and present references to the Holocaust is to state the obvious.1 Strong emotional experiences constitute much of how people encounter the topic through moving testimonies and melodramatic representations. Many popular depictions of the Holocaust, along with museum exhibitions and memorials, make explicit use of personal objects that belonged to the victims, as well as photographs, individual accounts, and artworks made of and by Holocaust victims. They give viewers, readers, and visitors a sense of personal and emotional connection that elicits empathy for the suffering of unfamiliar people from the past.2 In doing so, such artifacts and sites of commemoration also aim to regulate what feelings are “appropriate” and what behavior is expected from members of a particular society and group.3 For example, as Esra Özyürek has shown, a guide in a German concentration camp memorial felt uneasy about visits of students from Turkish and Arab families, who “start to feel they will be sent there next.” Rather than display the requisite public performance of empathy toward Jewish victims and accepting historical responsibility as part of the German “nation of perpetrators,” the students expressed their own fears of becoming victims in a society that had witnessed an increase in Islamophobia over the last decade.4",https://doi.org/10.1093/hgs/dcaf052,2025-12-02T00:00:00,,2025-12-02T00:00:00,,journal-article,2025-12-05 06:10:08.862567

Their accounts are often cited to illustrate situations or interactions, while scholarship has tended to portray them primarily in negative terms, or as symbols of individual and collective Jewish tragedy. Their perspectives as subjects, however, remain largely unexplored. This article explores how Jewish policemen narrated their experiences and represented themselves in their writings. It demonstrates how their awareness of documenting events for an anonymous future reader led them to blur or minimize their intimate, individual voice, even when it merely seemed to surface in the text. The policemen frequently erased the uniqueness of their role, subsuming it within a broader system of argumentation that aligned their behaviors with those of Jewish leadership or the wider Jewish population. A reading against the grain, through details, anecdotes, and arguments they unintentionally employed, reveals layers of their narration that they chose to ignore. In this way, it becomes possible to glimpse attitudes, topics, and situations they excluded from their accounts.",https://doi.org/10.1093/hgs/dcaf055,2025-12-02T00:00:00,,2025-12-02T00:00:00,,journal-article,2025-12-05 06:10:08.862472

10.1093/hgs/dcaf056,Neighbors in the Netherlands: The Holocaust and the Dutch Town of Hilversum,"von Frijtag Drabbe Künzel, Geraldien",Holocaust and Genocide Studies,Holo Geno Stud,8756-6583,,,,"Abstract In this article the author explores how intimacy and familiarity played into the history of the Holocaust in the Netherlands. The two concepts are key to research on the Holocaust in Eastern Europe, yet are largely disregarded when it comes to the Holocaust in the Netherlands. Our general perception of the Holocaust in the Netherlands is that of a well-organized, top-down policy: a gradual, bloodless procedure that ended in an anonymous, collective death in the camps of “the East”—the exact opposite of an intimate history of a local community. Using the concept of social death as a frame of analysis, this article investigates the developments in the town of Hilversum during the first two and a half years of the German occupation. In this period, the marginalization and expulsion of the 2,461 Jews in town began. What is immediately striking is the German absence from this story. The initiators of anti-Jewish agitation were local Nazis, and the first restrictions on free movement were issued by the town's mayor. Both actions evoked individual and collective disapproval from fellow citizens. This disapproval underlines the rootedness of Jews in Hilversum, and slowed down the process of their “social death.” It also illustrates the communal character of the Holocaust in this early phase; it touched the broader community of the Dutch town. Thus, this close-up perspective on the Holocaust in a Dutch town reveals how it should be understood as a communal and intimate history. Violence in Hilversum during the Holocaust differed markedly from violence in most towns in Nazi-ruled Eastern Europe; however, in its communal and intimate character there are more similarities between the two geographical stages than one would expect.",https://doi.org/10.1093/hgs/dcaf056,2025-11-27T00:00:00,,2025-11-27T00:00:00,,journal-article,2025-11-28 06:09:52.640660

It specifically explores nonlinguistic screams as expressions of fear, employing methods from a variety of academic fields. Holocaust soundscapes resounded with the screams of terrified victims. For the scream-emitters, the oral outbursts were sonic signs of the fear that emanated from within their bodies. Fear was, indeed, fully embodied, flowing kinesthetically within bodies, from releasing adrenaline to falling into a state of semiconsciousness to unleashing nonlinguistic screams. Through screams, fear moved from one person to another, underscoring the social transmissibility of fear. For the auditors, the victim-earwitnesses, hearing the screams of others often activated their own sense of fear, and many joined together in episodes of collective screaming. In their narration of screaming experiences, Jews often invoked screams to signal their psychological breakdown. At the same time, screams functioned as metaphors that they employed in an effort to recount their psychic rupture at the moment of trauma. This analysis demonstrates that emotions played a determinant role in Jews’ experiences and memories of the Holocaust.",https://doi.org/10.1093/hgs/dcaf047,2025-11-27T00:00:00,,2025-11-27T00:00:00,,journal-article,2025-11-28 06:09:52.640574

Situations that threatened the exposure of that difference, efforts to avoid such situations, and responses when such situations became unavoidable play a significant role in survivor testimony and memoir literature. Yet to date, there has been no extensive scholarly study of the manifold ways in which circumcision impacted Jewish survival.

Drawing on the extensive forms of testimony provided by the group throughout the postwar era, I argue for understanding the centrality of homosocial bonding to the Birkenau Boys’ attempts to reconstruct their lives following the violent end of the Holocaust. This essay begins with a discussion of liberation itself and the ways in which the boys’ memories challenge notions of liberation as a moment of complete rupture. I continue to follow the boys’ social relationships as they traverse Europe, with many spending time in makeshift Allied hospitals and Czech convalescent homes. The article concludes with a discussion of emigration considerations and of the ways in which the story of the Birkenau Boys can shift our understandings of Jewish children's lives during the momentous changes wrought by the end of the Holocaust.",https://doi.org/10.1093/hgs/dcaf051,2025-11-24T00:00:00,,2025-11-24T00:00:00,,journal-article,2025-11-28 06:09:52.640420

Israeli synagogue ethnography represents a rich and largely untapped field for anthropological research, making this work potentially groundbreaking in opening new avenues of inquiry. This article presents an ethnographic work that reveals a nuanced analytical layer for understanding liturgical practices in contemporary Israeli synagogue life. The article introduces the concept of “Ritual in Overload” to examine the gaps between ceremonial ideals and their cultural enactment, between prescribed ritual forms and their lived realization. The research relies on two extended ethnographic demonstrations, and provides some insights into the tension between institutional religious demands and individual spiritual needs. The result is a nuanced perspective on adaptation rather than abandonment in modern Orthodox practice. The two case studies, reading Sabbath pamphlets in Religious Zionist communities and establishing fast-paced prayer groups in Sephardic Haredi communities, provide valuable insights into contemporary dynamics of synagogue life. In applying Nissan Rubin’s concept of “twisting frames,” the author offers an alternative to conventional narratives about religious change that emphasize either rigid adherence or complete abandonment of tradition.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s12397-025-09682-x,2025-11-26T00:00:00,2025-12-01T00:00:00,2025-11-26T00:00:00,,journal-article,2025-11-28 06:09:49.007033

Observing Integration, Identities, and Language Exposure among G1.5 Immigrants","Shabtaev, Ronald",Contemporary Jewry,Contemp Jewry,0147-1694,45.0,4.0,,"Abstract Juhuri (Judeo-Tat) is an endangered minority language spoken by Mountain Jews (MJ), a community of immigrants from the Caucasus now living in Israel and the United States. Over the past century, Juhuri has rarely been used exclusively, existing in the shadow of Russian in the former Soviet Union, or Hebrew and English in Israel and the U.S., respectively. Juhuri has survived as a traditional heritage language to a limited extent, mainly in home and family domains, but has hardly been passed on to younger generations. The current study aims to identify possible predictors of Juhuri proficiency in comprehension and production, focusing specifically on middle-generation MJs who arrived in Israel and the U.S. from late childhood to early adolescence. Questionnaire data were used to assess the relative contribution of several factors to proficiency, including socioeconomic integration, MJ identity, national (Israeli/American) identity, and exposure to both Juhuri and the adjacent heritage (Russian) and societal (Hebrew/English) languages. Findings revealed stronger Juhuri proficiency in Israel than in the U.S. Exposure to Russian had a negative effect on Juhuri proficiency in both countries. While integration in Israel was a negative predictor, national and MJ identities were positive predictors. Results are discussed in light of research on heritage languages, immigration, and identity, as well as the sociocultural differences between the two countries.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s12397-025-09683-w,2025-11-19T00:00:00,2025-12-01T00:00:00,2025-11-19T00:00:00,,journal-article,2025-11-21 06:09:45.620443

It draws on refugee files gathered in the Spanish archives and autobiographical accounts created by the survivors to explore three aspects leading to their illegal escape across the Pyrenees: first, the antisemitic persecution that these Polish Jews experienced in France; second, their strategies and decision-making process leading to eventual passage to Spain; and third, the various ways in which the refugees prepared for this endeavor. For most Polish Jews, the illegal border crossing to Spain was an option of last resort used only when they felt that remaining in France, even in hiding, put their lives in imminent danger. Although they had heard of or experienced firsthand various anti-Jewish measures introduced in France throughout the war, it was not until the latter half of 1942, after massive roundups and the full German occupation of France, that they eventually decided in favor of a clandestine escape to Spain. Even so, their flight was not spontaneous but well-thought-out and carefully planned. By analyzing Polish Jews’ decision to flee from France, this article sheds light on the patterns of behavior that Polish and other Eastern European Jews shared in the face of antisemitic persecution in Western Europe throughout the war.",https://doi.org/10.1093/hgs/dcaf049,2025-11-11T00:00:00,,2025-11-11T00:00:00,,journal-article,2025-11-14 06:09:49.495621

The site where the disaster occurred, at the entrance to the Toldos Aharon Hasidic group’s ceremonial area, exemplifies how ultra-Orthodox communities navigate autonomy within Israel’s complex system of holy site management. This pattern reflects broader dynamics in Israeli society’s tendency to transform temporary improvisations into permanent institutions. The preservation of such arrangements has evolved from makeshift solutions to governance practice, particularly visible in contexts of religious significance, ethnic complexity, and contested sovereignty, from holy sites and Haredi communities to natural resources and border regions. Through examination of the Meron case alongside other instances of negotiated authority, this article demonstrates how ex-territorial arrangements in Israel serve not merely as practical responses to seemingly intractable conflicts, but as spaces where governance ambiguity becomes institutionalized. While these arrangements facilitate coexistence of competing claims, they simultaneously create regulatory vacuums where even basic safety considerations remain unaddressed. The Meron disaster thus illuminates not only the specific challenges of holy site management, but also the broader paradox of a modern state where the preservation of ambiguity has evolved into a characteristic mode of governance.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s12397-025-09690-x,2025-11-07T00:00:00,2025-12-01T00:00:00,2025-11-07T00:00:00,,journal-article,2025-11-14 06:09:44.271524

The survey, based on the EU Fundamental Rights Agency’s (FRA) questionnaire, gathered 334 responses—representing approximately 17–22% of Finland’s Jewish population over the age of 16. A significant majority of respondents reported a rise in antisemitism over the past 5 years, particularly in online spaces, media, and political discourse. The qualitative interviews not only confirmed these findings but also offered deeper insight into more subtle and complex manifestations of antisemitism, including ambient and implicit forms. Informants described the normalization of antisemitic tropes—especially in relation to criticism of Israel—as contributing to an atmosphere of discomfort, even when the expressions themselves were not overtly antisemitic. These expressions were often linked to discussions surrounding the war in Gaza and were predominantly associated with left-wing political narratives.

But of these, the majority—between 190,000 and 220,000—found sanctuary inside the USSR and thereby escaped becoming victims of the Nazi atrocities unleashed upon European Jewry between 1939 and 1945. After the war ended, most returned to Poland under the Soviet–Polish agreement on the repatriation of former Polish citizens from the USSR, and within a few years many had departed for Palestine, the United States, Canada, Australia, and other countries. Their diverse survival paths during the war and later postwar emigration and dispersal have been thoroughly explored in recent historiography. However, nothing has been written on those Polish Jews who, despite the opportunity for repatriation, remained in the Soviet Union. This article is the first to explore the wartime and postwar experiences of some of the Polish Jews who continued to reside in one of the Soviet republics. Qualitative analyses of thirty-three USC Shoah Foundation testimonies recorded with Jewish Holocaust survivors in the mid-1990s and early 2000s provide insights into the various reasons, circumstances, and contingencies that caused them to stay. This research goes beyond the experiences of the majority and focuses on the postwar life trajectories of the roughly 10 percent of Polish Jews who survived in the wartime USSR and then settled in Russia, Ukraine, and other Soviet republics and made their lives as Soviet citizens.",https://doi.org/10.1093/hgs/dcaf041,2025-10-28T00:00:00,,2025-10-28T00:00:00,,journal-article,2025-10-31 06:09:13.426989

10.1093/mj/kjaf014,THE “FAILURE OF SUCCESS” IN ENLIGHTENMENT THOUGHT: JONATHAN SACKS AS A JEWISH PHILOSOPHER,"Feldmann-Kaye, Miriam",Modern Judaism,Mod Judaism,1086-3273,,,,"ABSTRACT This article focuses on the Enlightenment and its implications for modern Jewish philosophy in the thought of Jonathan Sacks (1948–2020). It will examine how the philosophical ideas of Kant, Hegel, Voltaire, Nietzsche, and others led Sacks to take a position which claimed that the “abstract universalism” of Enlightenment thought had failed. The premise for this conclusion was rooted in the Shoah which he viewed in a philosophical sense as the culmination of the Enlightenment. That is, the “Final Solution” had not been prevented by modern values but, rather, had been propelled by aspects of Enlightenment thought. This essay analyzes the role that Spinoza played for Sacks as representative of a Jewish figure who contributed to Enlightenment values and thus complexified his claims. The discipline of “Modern Jewish thought”—discussed here in relation to Rabbis A. I. Kook and Samson Raphael Hirsch—presented challenges and required redefinition owing to Sacks’ relation to the Enlightenment. These challenges came in the form of postmodernism and the ethical relativism it entailed, and the quest to retain ethics as the first priority according to the views of Levinas and others. Thus, this essay brings Sacks into conversation with several other philosophers and Jewish thinkers and puts forward an original perspective on a new contribution to contemporary Jewish thought.",https://doi.org/10.1093/mj/kjaf014,2025-10-29T00:00:00,,2025-10-29T00:00:00,,journal-article,2025-10-31 06:08:57.720065

The study employs the “dwelling perspective,” suggesting locations acquire social meaning as symbols of those who lived there, creating powerful connections between place and collective memory. Masada represents ancient Jewish resistance and national liberty, becoming embedded in Zionist ideology; Polish death camps reinforce contemporary Jewish identity by demonstrating powerlessness consequences while strengthening connections to Israel as refuge; and Givat Hatachmoshet commemorates the 1967 Jerusalem battle, connecting visitors to recent Israeli military heroism. The central thesis argues that these pilgrimages facilitate fundamental transformation in Jewish identity—shifting from the “rabbinical Jew” characterized by defensive exile strategies toward reclaiming the “biblical Jew” embodying the offensive, assertive ethos of strength and self-determination. Through active engagement with these sites representing chronological progression from ancient resistance through modern victimization to contemporary empowerment, participants experience visceral connections to Jewish power and sovereignty rather than merely intellectual historical learning, demonstrating how physical spaces become crucial tools for reconstructing collective identity and cultural meaning.",https://doi.org/10.1093/mj/kjaf016,2025-10-29T00:00:00,,2025-10-29T00:00:00,,journal-article,2025-10-31 06:08:57.719995

They occupy a liminal “outsider within” position in their communities. Through analysis of four characters—Sharon Kahn’s Ruby Rothman (1998–2006), Rochelle Krich’s Molly Blume (2002–2005), Naomi Graetz’s Toby Kramer (2004), and Brenda Barrie’s Dan Goldin (2011), all rabbi’s-spouse sleuths—the article reveals how this innovative subgenre creates protagonists who navigate between insider knowledge and outsider perspective. Unlike conventional clerical detective fiction, these works feature characters who lack formal religious authority yet possess privileged community access. The protagonists of these novels employ distinct investigative approaches, from amateur detection to academic research methods. The subgenre’s emergence in early twenty-first century works, all by female authors, represents a significant literary innovation that challenges traditional representations of Jewish leadership and gender dynamics. By transforming the marginalized position of the rabbi’s spouse into a narrative advantage, these works create a unique literary space where questions of religious identity, gender equality, and cultural belonging can be explored through the accessible medium of mystery fiction.",https://doi.org/10.1093/mj/kjaf015,2025-10-29T00:00:00,,2025-10-29T00:00:00,,journal-article,2025-10-31 06:08:57.719922

                    <i>THE TALE OF A NIGGUN</i>","Reiser, Daniel",Modern Judaism,Mod Judaism,1086-3273,,,,"ABSTRACT This study examines Elie Wiesel’s overlooked poem “The Tale of a Niggun,” originally published in 1978 but forgotten until its republication in 2020. Through literary and historical analysis, the paper demonstrates how Wiesel artfully reconstructs the essence of Hasidism and the Hasidic Niggun, offering an innovative post-Holocaust perspective. The poem depicts a ghetto rabbi facing an impossible Nazi demand—to select ten Jews for hanging on Purim as revenge for Haman’s sons. During a spiritual odyssey, the rabbi encounters great Jewish figures—Maimonides, the Baal Shem Tov, the Vilna Gaon, and Rabbi Levi Yitzchak of Berditchev—ultimately choosing community solidarity over individual sacrifice. Historical research reveals the poem’s basis in actual 1942 executions in Nazi-occupied Poland. Wiesel redefines Hasidism as fundamentally communal rather than mystical, where unity transcends even life itself. The Hasidic Niggun becomes an eternal symbol oscillating between divine presence and absence, connecting survivors to Jewish tradition despite the rupture of the Holocaust. The study positions Wiesel as a crucial cultural agent transmitting both Holocaust memory and Hasidic legacy to future generations.",https://doi.org/10.1093/mj/kjaf018,2025-10-29T00:00:00,,2025-10-29T00:00:00,,journal-article,2025-10-31 06:08:57.719844

The article focuses on a key pillar of this paradigm shift in the official historical narrative promoted by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), namely, its “internationalization.” Whereas previously the official CCP-promoted historical reading of the Second World War focused on domestic resistance against Japanese aggression, in the “Xi Jinping Era,” the conflict discursively positions China in the role of a key and decisive actor of the “World Anti-Fascist War.” By focusing on two major state-run memorial museums in China—the Museum of the War of Chinese People's Resistance against Japanese Aggression and the Memorial Hall of the Victims in Nanjing Massacre by Japanese Invaders—the article unpacks key aspects of the shift toward internationalization by addressing China's rebranding of its historical role as one of the victorious Allies of the Second World War, instrumentalization of Holocaust history through a newly enforced emphasis on Shanghai as a wartime refuge, and engagement with transnational musealization strategies. Through a study of how these trends come into being in museum spaces, the article analyzes the internationalization of Second World War memory in the PRC as an inherent part of Xi Jinping's ambition to consolidate China as a global power, a leading member of the United Nations, and a moral force in the international community.",https://doi.org/10.1093/hgs/dcaf038,2025-10-15T00:00:00,,2025-10-15T00:00:00,,journal-article,2025-10-23 22:13:35.466694

This article explores experiments with more multifaceted—and “integrated” (per Saul Friedländer)—mapping of Holocaust space and place to include the emotional dimensions of spatial experience. Drawing on Agnew and Duncan's influential introduction of place as a triad that encompasses location, locale, and sense of place, we seek to map the Holocaust as a complex spatial experience. Agnew and Duncan's definition incorporates the idea of abstract space as it is understood in GIScience (location); the social, cultural, political, economic, and material dimensions of place (locale); and the behavioral and emotional component of place (sense of place). Drawing on a close reading of two Holocaust survivors’ narratives, we map their shifting experiences (over both and time and space) at different spatial scales with a particular focus on exploring the relationships between people, place, events, and emotions. The two survivors—Gilberto Salmoni and Gabor Somjen—represent trajectories at two different scales (the continental and city scale, respectively) and two different national contexts (Italy and Hungary) that went through several different locales, not only locations. The article offers a representational model that allows for comparative research of the Holocaust experience at the resolution of the individual that is scalable in two ways: It can include any number of testimonies, and it can graphically render the events and places of the Holocaust at multiple scales and for different spatiotemporal experiences. While critically assessing the limits of the model—specifically vis-à-vis representing emotions and sense of place—the article suggests the value of comparative cartographic analysis in understanding the shifting emotional landscapes of the Holocaust and the place-based nature of victim experience.",https://doi.org/10.1093/hgs/dcaf044,2025-10-22T00:00:00,,2025-10-22T00:00:00,,journal-article,2025-10-23 22:13:35.466594

Using feminist narrative analysis of qualitative interviews, we argue familial contexts serve as core formative spaces for constructing lived religion and sustaining young Mizrahi-Masorti Jewish-Israelis’ identities, often excluded from educational institutions and cultural frameworks. Our study reveals lived religion as an intergenerational process of sustaining practices, beliefs, and identities through the interplay of formal and informal, individual and collective, and intimate and political dimensions. By broadening and innovating the concepts of “relational spirituality” and a “theology of care,” we demonstrate how religious life emerges from dynamic divisions of “spiritual labor” within commitments to, and care for, familial networks. Centering prayer practices, we show how relationships with the divine are shaped in familial terms, expressed through flexible gendered roles and an ethic of care that carries cultural and political significance. It contributes to the study of lived religion by challenging its Western individualistic focus instead highlighting relational, collective, and marginalized dimensions.
