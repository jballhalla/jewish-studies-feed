          "abstract": "Abstract Moses Naḥmanides’s complex relationship in his commentary to the Torah with the two great Jewish Bible commentators who preceded him—Rashi and Ibn Ezra—is well known. As he declares in the introductory poem to the commentary, he does not treat them equally. He grants Rashi “the right of the first-born,” relegating Ibn Ezra to second place, and that his relationship with Ibn Ezra will be far more fraught—one of “open rebuke and hidden love.” This article maintains, however, that neither Naḥmanides’s stated preference for Rashi nor his sharp criticism of Ibn Ezra reflects his original exegetical stance. At the outset of his interpretive career, it was in fact Ibn Ezra who commanded Naḥmanides’s special admiration. Ibn Ezra’s commentary—not Rashi’s—served as the point of departure for Naḥmanides’s earliest exegetical work. Rashi’s influence entered Naḥmanides’s corpus only gradually, forming part of the larger cultural transformation he experienced as his intellectual orientation shifted from Andalusia to northern France.",

          "abstract": "Abstract This article reconsiders the Ḥatam Sofer’s attitude toward print, arguing that it reflects a historically specific response to a crisis of rabbinic authority and transmission. Instead of approaching print as a neutral technological development, the article shows how Sofer employed the contrast between manuscript and print as a symbolic language for expressing substantive views on authority, loss, and an idealized past in which Torah knowledge was guardedly transmitted and evaluated. His nostalgic portrayal of the manuscript age—historically inaccurate yet rhetorically effective—served to imagine an idealized world of learning governed by rabbinic judgment, restraint, and ordered transmission. Drawing on responsa, letters, and biographical contexts, the article demonstrates that Sofer’s reflections on print are closely tied to his self-identification as a teacher rather than an “author”—a distinctive model of rabbinic authority inherited from his own teacher, Rabbi Natan Adler. In this paradigm, manuscript culture persists not only as a material practice in the age of print but as a symbolic framework through which Sofer asserted authority, expressed anxiety, and shaped his scholarly persona. Viewed through the prism of rabbinic agency, the article reconceives standard approaches in the history of the book and shows how concepts internal to rabbinic culture—such as Torah study undertaken for its own sake ( lishmah ) and innovative interpretation ( ḥiddush )—actively shaped modes of knowledge production rather than merely reflecting broader, universal patterns.",

          "abstract": "Abstract This essay examines a responsa by Moses Schreiber (Ḥatam Sofer) in which he addresses the implications of print and mechanical reproduction for Jewish books. Schreiber’s approach to print is strikingly ambivalent. On the one hand, he was an active and influential figure in the world of Hebrew printing—regulating printing activity, supporting publishers, endorsing books, and writing haskamot (approbations). On the other hand, he adamantly refused to allow his own writings to be printed. While scholarship on Schreiber has noted and documented this refusal, the present essay offers an additional layer of interpretation. I argue that Schreiber’s objections to the printing of his own work open a window onto his working methods and his views on scholarship and knowledge. Reading his responsa through two conceptual frameworks— migrating knowledge and the history of the book —this essay explores questions of the creation, transmission, and transformation of knowledge; the contrasting qualities attributed to hand-copied and press-printed texts; and the perceived fixity of the printed book and its impact on scholarly practice.",

          "abstract": "Abstract Caleb Afendopolo, a prominent Karaite scholar of the 15th–16th centuries Byzantine-Ottoman realm, was a commentator, philosopher, and poet. A prolific author, he composed numerous works on Karaite principles of faith, halakhah, exegesis, philosophy, and sciences. He was a product of the Byzantine Greek-speaking Karaite society and a contemporary of the enormous wave of immigration in the Ottoman Empire of Jews expelled from the Iberian Peninsula who brought with them new intellectual trends that influenced his views and thought. His writings include fragments that contain anti-Christian polemics that have remained beyond the scope of scholarly research. Afendopolo’s polemical discourse addresses mainly heresiographic and legal issues based on historical arguments. His approach demonstrates a striking gap between a surprisingly positive image of the historical Jesus and fierce criticism of Christianity, encompassing some of its contemporary practices. The present study aims to reconstruct his perspective of Christianity in the context of major Rabbanite and especially Karaite polemical tendencies. For the first time, this article also presents fragments of anti-Christian polemics from Afendopolo’s works.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Moses Naḥmanides’s complex relationship in his commentary to the Torah with the two great Jewish Bible commentators who preceded him—Rashi and Ibn Ezra—is well known. As he declares in the introductory poem to the commentary, he does not treat them equally. He grants Rashi “the right of the first-born,” relegating Ibn Ezra to second place, and that his relationship with Ibn Ezra will be far more fraught—one of “open rebuke and hidden love.” This article maintains, however, that neither Naḥmanides’s stated preference for Rashi nor his sharp criticism of Ibn Ezra reflects his original exegetical stance. At the outset of his interpretive career, it was in fact Ibn Ezra who commanded Naḥmanides’s special admiration. Ibn Ezra’s commentary—not Rashi’s—served as the point of departure for Naḥmanides’s earliest exegetical work. Rashi’s influence entered Naḥmanides’s corpus only gradually, forming part of the larger cultural transformation he experienced as his intellectual orientation shifted from Andalusia to northern France.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This article reconsiders the Ḥatam Sofer’s attitude toward print, arguing that it reflects a historically specific response to a crisis of rabbinic authority and transmission. Instead of approaching print as a neutral technological development, the article shows how Sofer employed the contrast between manuscript and print as a symbolic language for expressing substantive views on authority, loss, and an idealized past in which Torah knowledge was guardedly transmitted and evaluated. His nostalgic portrayal of the manuscript age—historically inaccurate yet rhetorically effective—served to imagine an idealized world of learning governed by rabbinic judgment, restraint, and ordered transmission. Drawing on responsa, letters, and biographical contexts, the article demonstrates that Sofer’s reflections on print are closely tied to his self-identification as a teacher rather than an “author”—a distinctive model of rabbinic authority inherited from his own teacher, Rabbi Natan Adler. In this paradigm, manuscript culture persists not only as a material practice in the age of print but as a symbolic framework through which Sofer asserted authority, expressed anxiety, and shaped his scholarly persona. Viewed through the prism of rabbinic agency, the article reconceives standard approaches in the history of the book and shows how concepts internal to rabbinic culture—such as Torah study undertaken for its own sake ( lishmah ) and innovative interpretation ( ḥiddush )—actively shaped modes of knowledge production rather than merely reflecting broader, universal patterns.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This essay examines a responsa by Moses Schreiber (Ḥatam Sofer) in which he addresses the implications of print and mechanical reproduction for Jewish books. Schreiber’s approach to print is strikingly ambivalent. On the one hand, he was an active and influential figure in the world of Hebrew printing—regulating printing activity, supporting publishers, endorsing books, and writing haskamot (approbations). On the other hand, he adamantly refused to allow his own writings to be printed. While scholarship on Schreiber has noted and documented this refusal, the present essay offers an additional layer of interpretation. I argue that Schreiber’s objections to the printing of his own work open a window onto his working methods and his views on scholarship and knowledge. Reading his responsa through two conceptual frameworks— migrating knowledge and the history of the book —this essay explores questions of the creation, transmission, and transformation of knowledge; the contrasting qualities attributed to hand-copied and press-printed texts; and the perceived fixity of the printed book and its impact on scholarly practice.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Caleb Afendopolo, a prominent Karaite scholar of the 15th–16th centuries Byzantine-Ottoman realm, was a commentator, philosopher, and poet. A prolific author, he composed numerous works on Karaite principles of faith, halakhah, exegesis, philosophy, and sciences. He was a product of the Byzantine Greek-speaking Karaite society and a contemporary of the enormous wave of immigration in the Ottoman Empire of Jews expelled from the Iberian Peninsula who brought with them new intellectual trends that influenced his views and thought. His writings include fragments that contain anti-Christian polemics that have remained beyond the scope of scholarly research. Afendopolo’s polemical discourse addresses mainly heresiographic and legal issues based on historical arguments. His approach demonstrates a striking gap between a surprisingly positive image of the historical Jesus and fierce criticism of Christianity, encompassing some of its contemporary practices. The present study aims to reconstruct his perspective of Christianity in the context of major Rabbanite and especially Karaite polemical tendencies. For the first time, this article also presents fragments of anti-Christian polemics from Afendopolo’s works.",
