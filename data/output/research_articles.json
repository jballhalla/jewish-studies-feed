          "abstract": "Abstract This article analyzes two emotions present in liberator narratives concerning Nazi camps: anger and disgust. When the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp was liberated, even the most battle-hardened soldier was overwhelmed by the aftermath of the brutal crimes perpetrated in the camp, and many Allied personnel were angered to the point that they exacted violent reprisals on members of the Schutzstaffel (SS). Moreover, in the eyes of the liberators the behavior of the survivors was abnormal and illogical, and the sight and smell of them evoked feelings of disgust. Personnel often described the survivors using animal metaphors—a type of zoomorphic language. Liberators experienced a broad range of negative emotions, and yet their responses demonstrate similar patterns of thought, language, imagery, and metaphors. While each soldier presented their own perspective of the experience, there is a discernible overlap in what they documented.",

          "abstract": "Abstract Ensuring that Jewish educational initiatives address the growing diversity of the US Jewish community requires, in part, understanding the background characteristics of participants and how a given educational program affects the trajectory of Jewish engagement for those with little, moderate, or a substantial amount of prior Jewish education and experiences. The present paper undertakes this analysis using the example of Birthright Israel. First, using latent class analysis, we develop a data-informed typology for classifying different religious and cultural childhood experiences of American Jewish young adults. We then examine the extent to which each group in the typology is impacted by participation in Birthright Israel, using an analytic approach that compares pre- and post-trip responses for both individuals who participated in Birthright Israel and a comparison group of those who applied but did not participate. We find that for some measures, Birthright Israel has a significant impact on participants with a variety of background experiences, while for other outcomes, Birthright Israel’s impact is concentrated among those with the least exposure to Jewish life.",

The present paper undertakes this analysis using the example of Birthright Israel. First, using latent class analysis, we develop a data-informed typology for classifying different religious and cultural childhood experiences of American Jewish young adults. We then examine the extent to which each group in the typology is impacted by participation in Birthright Israel, using an analytic approach that compares pre- and post-trip responses for both individuals who participated in Birthright Israel and a comparison group of those who applied but did not participate. We find that for some measures, Birthright Israel has a significant impact on participants with a variety of background experiences, while for other outcomes, Birthright Israel’s impact is concentrated among those with the least exposure to Jewish life.",
