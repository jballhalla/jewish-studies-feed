          "abstract": "Abstract In this article the author explores how intimacy and familiarity played into the history of the Holocaust in the Netherlands. The two concepts are key to research on the Holocaust in Eastern Europe, yet are largely disregarded when it comes to the Holocaust in the Netherlands. Our general perception of the Holocaust in the Netherlands is that of a well-organized, top-down policy: a gradual, bloodless procedure that ended in an anonymous, collective death in the camps of “the East”—the exact opposite of an intimate history of a local community. Using the concept of social death as a frame of analysis, this article investigates the developments in the town of Hilversum during the first two and a half years of the German occupation. In this period, the marginalization and expulsion of the 2,461 Jews in town began. What is immediately striking is the German absence from this story. The initiators of anti-Jewish agitation were local Nazis, and the first restrictions on free movement were issued by the town's mayor. Both actions evoked individual and collective disapproval from fellow citizens. This disapproval underlines the rootedness of Jews in Hilversum, and slowed down the process of their “social death.” It also illustrates the communal character of the Holocaust in this early phase; it touched the broader community of the Dutch town. Thus, this close-up perspective on the Holocaust in a Dutch town reveals how it should be understood as a communal and intimate history. Violence in Hilversum during the Holocaust differed markedly from violence in most towns in Nazi-ruled Eastern Europe; however, in its communal and intimate character there are more similarities between the two geographical stages than one would expect.",

It specifically explores nonlinguistic screams as expressions of fear, employing methods from a variety of academic fields. Holocaust soundscapes resounded with the screams of terrified victims.

Fear was, indeed, fully embodied, flowing kinesthetically within bodies, from releasing adrenaline to falling into a state of semiconsciousness to unleashing nonlinguistic screams.

          "abstract": "Abstract In Nazi-occupied Europe, even with authentic identity documents, linguistic fluency, knowledge of Christian prayers and practices, and “Aryan” appearance, Jewish male anatomy was destiny: a Jew, bearing the singular mark of (male) Jewish difference, circumcision, was ever at risk. Situations that threatened the exposure of that difference, efforts to avoid such situations, and responses when such situations became unavoidable play a significant role in survivor testimony and memoir literature. Yet to date, there has been no extensive scholarly study of the manifold ways in which circumcision impacted Jewish survival. After indicating the necessity to undertake the first comprehensive study of this crucial constraint on Jewish survival during the Shoah, this research note addresses the difficulties faced in pursuing such research in the audiovisual archive and in codifying the data. It then suggests how to resolve these issues to more fully display and reckon with how living-while-circumcised affected the many forms of life and modes of death, alongside the resilience and resourcefulness, the fear and fatalism, of Jews during the Shoah.",

          "abstract": "Abstract This article examines the experiences of the self-titled “Birkenau Boys,” a group of eighty-nine children from the Theresienstadt Family Camp, half of whom survived the war, as they faced the challenges of liberation and its immediate aftermath. Drawing on the extensive forms of testimony provided by the group throughout the postwar era, I argue for understanding the centrality of homosocial bonding to the Birkenau Boys’ attempts to reconstruct their lives following the violent end of the Holocaust. This essay begins with a discussion of liberation itself and the ways in which the boys’ memories challenge notions of liberation as a moment of complete rupture. I continue to follow the boys’ social relationships as they traverse Europe, with many spending time in makeshift Allied hospitals and Czech convalescent homes. The article concludes with a discussion of emigration considerations and of the ways in which the story of the Birkenau Boys can shift our understandings of Jewish children's lives during the momentous changes wrought by the end of the Holocaust.",

          "abstract": "Abstract The focus on “lived religion” as a framework within the sociology of religion provides crucial attention to actual practice in religious life, including its rhythm, duration, and routine presence as part of life in general. Israeli synagogue ethnography represents a rich and largely untapped field for anthropological research, making this work potentially groundbreaking in opening new avenues of inquiry. This article presents an ethnographic work that reveals a nuanced analytical layer for understanding liturgical practices in contemporary Israeli synagogue life. The article introduces the concept of “Ritual in Overload” to examine the gaps between ceremonial ideals and their cultural enactment, between prescribed ritual forms and their lived realization. The research relies on two extended ethnographic demonstrations, and provides some insights into the tension between institutional religious demands and individual spiritual needs. The result is a nuanced perspective on adaptation rather than abandonment in modern Orthodox practice. The two case studies, reading Sabbath pamphlets in Religious Zionist communities and establishing fast-paced prayer groups in Sephardic Haredi communities, provide valuable insights into contemporary dynamics of synagogue life. In applying Nissan Rubin’s concept of “twisting frames,” the author offers an alternative to conventional narratives about religious change that emphasize either rigid adherence or complete abandonment of tradition.",

      "abstract": "Abstract In Nazi-occupied Europe, even with authentic identity documents, linguistic fluency, knowledge of Christian prayers and practices, and “Aryan” appearance, Jewish male anatomy was destiny: a Jew, bearing the singular mark of (male) Jewish difference, circumcision, was ever at risk. Situations that threatened the exposure of that difference, efforts to avoid such situations, and responses when such situations became unavoidable play a significant role in survivor testimony and memoir literature. Yet to date, there has been no extensive scholarly study of the manifold ways in which circumcision impacted Jewish survival. After indicating the necessity to undertake the first comprehensive study of this crucial constraint on Jewish survival during the Shoah, this research note addresses the difficulties faced in pursuing such research in the audiovisual archive and in codifying the data. It then suggests how to resolve these issues to more fully display and reckon with how living-while-circumcised affected the many forms of life and modes of death, alongside the resilience and resourcefulness, the fear and fatalism, of Jews during the Shoah.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This article examines the experiences of the self-titled “Birkenau Boys,” a group of eighty-nine children from the Theresienstadt Family Camp, half of whom survived the war, as they faced the challenges of liberation and its immediate aftermath. Drawing on the extensive forms of testimony provided by the group throughout the postwar era, I argue for understanding the centrality of homosocial bonding to the Birkenau Boys’ attempts to reconstruct their lives following the violent end of the Holocaust. This essay begins with a discussion of liberation itself and the ways in which the boys’ memories challenge notions of liberation as a moment of complete rupture. I continue to follow the boys’ social relationships as they traverse Europe, with many spending time in makeshift Allied hospitals and Czech convalescent homes. The article concludes with a discussion of emigration considerations and of the ways in which the story of the Birkenau Boys can shift our understandings of Jewish children's lives during the momentous changes wrought by the end of the Holocaust.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The focus on “lived religion” as a framework within the sociology of religion provides crucial attention to actual practice in religious life, including its rhythm, duration, and routine presence as part of life in general. Israeli synagogue ethnography represents a rich and largely untapped field for anthropological research, making this work potentially groundbreaking in opening new avenues of inquiry. This article presents an ethnographic work that reveals a nuanced analytical layer for understanding liturgical practices in contemporary Israeli synagogue life. The article introduces the concept of “Ritual in Overload” to examine the gaps between ceremonial ideals and their cultural enactment, between prescribed ritual forms and their lived realization. The research relies on two extended ethnographic demonstrations, and provides some insights into the tension between institutional religious demands and individual spiritual needs. The result is a nuanced perspective on adaptation rather than abandonment in modern Orthodox practice. The two case studies, reading Sabbath pamphlets in Religious Zionist communities and establishing fast-paced prayer groups in Sephardic Haredi communities, provide valuable insights into contemporary dynamics of synagogue life. In applying Nissan Rubin’s concept of “twisting frames,” the author offers an alternative to conventional narratives about religious change that emphasize either rigid adherence or complete abandonment of tradition.",
