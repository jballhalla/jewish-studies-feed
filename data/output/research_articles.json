          "abstract": "Abstract When Xi Jinping came to power in 2012, memory politics surrounding the Second World War, just as the People's Republic of China (PRC) itself, began to undergo a radical transformation. The article focuses on a key pillar of this paradigm shift in the official historical narrative promoted by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), namely, its “internationalization.” Whereas previously the official CCP-promoted historical reading of the Second World War focused on domestic resistance against Japanese aggression, in the “Xi Jinping Era,” the conflict discursively positions China in the role of a key and decisive actor of the “World Anti-Fascist War.” By focusing on two major state-run memorial museums in China—the Museum of the War of Chinese People's Resistance against Japanese Aggression and the Memorial Hall of the Victims in Nanjing Massacre by Japanese Invaders—the article unpacks key aspects of the shift toward internationalization by addressing China's rebranding of its historical role as one of the victorious Allies of the Second World War, instrumentalization of Holocaust history through a newly enforced emphasis on Shanghai as a wartime refuge, and engagement with transnational musealization strategies. Through a study of how these trends come into being in museum spaces, the article analyzes the internationalization of Second World War memory in the PRC as an inherent part of Xi Jinping's ambition to consolidate China as a global power, a leading member of the United Nations, and a moral force in the international community.",

          "abstract": "Abstract The “spatial turn” in Holocaust studies has led to renewed interest in mapping the Holocaust as both event and experience. This article explores experiments with more multifaceted—and “integrated” (per Saul Friedländer)—mapping of Holocaust space and place to include the emotional dimensions of spatial experience. Drawing on Agnew and Duncan's influential introduction of place as a triad that encompasses location, locale, and sense of place, we seek to map the Holocaust as a complex spatial experience. Agnew and Duncan's definition incorporates the idea of abstract space as it is understood in GIScience (location); the social, cultural, political, economic, and material dimensions of place (locale); and the behavioral and emotional component of place (sense of place). Drawing on a close reading of two Holocaust survivors’ narratives, we map their shifting experiences (over both and time and space) at different spatial scales with a particular focus on exploring the relationships between people, place, events, and emotions. The two survivors—Gilberto Salmoni and Gabor Somjen—represent trajectories at two different scales (the continental and city scale, respectively) and two different national contexts (Italy and Hungary) that went through several different locales, not only locations. The article offers a representational model that allows for comparative research of the Holocaust experience at the resolution of the individual that is scalable in two ways: It can include any number of testimonies, and it can graphically render the events and places of the Holocaust at multiple scales and for different spatiotemporal experiences. While critically assessing the limits of the model—specifically vis-à-vis representing emotions and sense of place—the article suggests the value of comparative cartographic analysis in understanding the shifting emotional landscapes of the Holocaust and the place-based nature of victim experience.",

      "abstract": "Abstract When Xi Jinping came to power in 2012, memory politics surrounding the Second World War, just as the People's Republic of China (PRC) itself, began to undergo a radical transformation. The article focuses on a key pillar of this paradigm shift in the official historical narrative promoted by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), namely, its “internationalization.” Whereas previously the official CCP-promoted historical reading of the Second World War focused on domestic resistance against Japanese aggression, in the “Xi Jinping Era,” the conflict discursively positions China in the role of a key and decisive actor of the “World Anti-Fascist War.” By focusing on two major state-run memorial museums in China—the Museum of the War of Chinese People's Resistance against Japanese Aggression and the Memorial Hall of the Victims in Nanjing Massacre by Japanese Invaders—the article unpacks key aspects of the shift toward internationalization by addressing China's rebranding of its historical role as one of the victorious Allies of the Second World War, instrumentalization of Holocaust history through a newly enforced emphasis on Shanghai as a wartime refuge, and engagement with transnational musealization strategies. Through a study of how these trends come into being in museum spaces, the article analyzes the internationalization of Second World War memory in the PRC as an inherent part of Xi Jinping's ambition to consolidate China as a global power, a leading member of the United Nations, and a moral force in the international community.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The “spatial turn” in Holocaust studies has led to renewed interest in mapping the Holocaust as both event and experience. This article explores experiments with more multifaceted—and “integrated” (per Saul Friedländer)—mapping of Holocaust space and place to include the emotional dimensions of spatial experience. Drawing on Agnew and Duncan's influential introduction of place as a triad that encompasses location, locale, and sense of place, we seek to map the Holocaust as a complex spatial experience. Agnew and Duncan's definition incorporates the idea of abstract space as it is understood in GIScience (location); the social, cultural, political, economic, and material dimensions of place (locale); and the behavioral and emotional component of place (sense of place). Drawing on a close reading of two Holocaust survivors’ narratives, we map their shifting experiences (over both and time and space) at different spatial scales with a particular focus on exploring the relationships between people, place, events, and emotions. The two survivors—Gilberto Salmoni and Gabor Somjen—represent trajectories at two different scales (the continental and city scale, respectively) and two different national contexts (Italy and Hungary) that went through several different locales, not only locations. The article offers a representational model that allows for comparative research of the Holocaust experience at the resolution of the individual that is scalable in two ways: It can include any number of testimonies, and it can graphically render the events and places of the Holocaust at multiple scales and for different spatiotemporal experiences. While critically assessing the limits of the model—specifically vis-à-vis representing emotions and sense of place—the article suggests the value of comparative cartographic analysis in understanding the shifting emotional landscapes of the Holocaust and the place-based nature of victim experience.",
