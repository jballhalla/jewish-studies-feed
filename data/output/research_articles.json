          "abstract": "Abstract This study explores the perceptions of antisemitism among Jews living in Finland, on the basis of a survey conducted between October and November 2023 and 42 semi-structured interviews carried out between March and June 2024. The survey, based on the EU Fundamental Rights Agency’s (FRA) questionnaire, gathered 334 responses—representing approximately 17–22% of Finland’s Jewish population over the age of 16. A significant majority of respondents reported a rise in antisemitism over the past 5 years, particularly in online spaces, media, and political discourse. The qualitative interviews not only confirmed these findings but also offered deeper insight into more subtle and complex manifestations of antisemitism, including ambient and implicit forms. Informants described the normalization of antisemitic tropes—especially in relation to criticism of Israel—as contributing to an atmosphere of discomfort, even when the expressions themselves were not overtly antisemitic. These expressions were often linked to discussions surrounding the war in Gaza and were predominantly associated with left-wing political narratives. The study highlights the persistence of both traditional and contemporary forms of antisemitism in Finland, indicating the need for further research and interventions to address this evolving issue.",
