          "abstract": "Abstract This article examines the flight of Polish Jews from France to Spain in the last months of 1942. It draws on refugee files gathered in the Spanish archives and autobiographical accounts created by the survivors to explore three aspects leading to their illegal escape across the Pyrenees: first, the antisemitic persecution that these Polish Jews experienced in France; second, their strategies and decision-making process leading to eventual passage to Spain; and third, the various ways in which the refugees prepared for this endeavor. For most Polish Jews, the illegal border crossing to Spain was an option of last resort used only when they felt that remaining in France, even in hiding, put their lives in imminent danger. Although they had heard of or experienced firsthand various anti-Jewish measures introduced in France throughout the war, it was not until the latter half of 1942, after massive roundups and the full German occupation of France, that they eventually decided in favor of a clandestine escape to Spain. Even so, their flight was not spontaneous but well-thought-out and carefully planned. By analyzing Polish Jews’ decision to flee from France, this article sheds light on the patterns of behavior that Polish and other Eastern European Jews shared in the face of antisemitic persecution in Western Europe throughout the war.",

          "abstract": "Abstract In the aftermath of the Meron disaster, where 45 people lost their lives during a Lag BaOmer celebration, it became evident that the tragedy stemmed from that most Israeli of solutions: the art of managing intractable problems through strategic nonmanagement. The site where the disaster occurred, at the entrance to the Toldos Aharon Hasidic group’s ceremonial area, exemplifies how ultra-Orthodox communities navigate autonomy within Israel’s complex system of holy site management. This pattern reflects broader dynamics in Israeli society’s tendency to transform temporary improvisations into permanent institutions. The preservation of such arrangements has evolved from makeshift solutions to governance practice, particularly visible in contexts of religious significance, ethnic complexity, and contested sovereignty, from holy sites and Haredi communities to natural resources and border regions. Through examination of the Meron case alongside other instances of negotiated authority, this article demonstrates how ex-territorial arrangements in Israel serve not merely as practical responses to seemingly intractable conflicts, but as spaces where governance ambiguity becomes institutionalized. While these arrangements facilitate coexistence of competing claims, they simultaneously create regulatory vacuums where even basic safety considerations remain unaddressed. The Meron disaster thus illuminates not only the specific challenges of holy site management, but also the broader paradox of a modern state where the preservation of ambiguity has evolved into a characteristic mode of governance.",

      "abstract": "Abstract In the aftermath of the Meron disaster, where 45 people lost their lives during a Lag BaOmer celebration, it became evident that the tragedy stemmed from that most Israeli of solutions: the art of managing intractable problems through strategic nonmanagement. The site where the disaster occurred, at the entrance to the Toldos Aharon Hasidic group’s ceremonial area, exemplifies how ultra-Orthodox communities navigate autonomy within Israel’s complex system of holy site management. This pattern reflects broader dynamics in Israeli society’s tendency to transform temporary improvisations into permanent institutions. The preservation of such arrangements has evolved from makeshift solutions to governance practice, particularly visible in contexts of religious significance, ethnic complexity, and contested sovereignty, from holy sites and Haredi communities to natural resources and border regions. Through examination of the Meron case alongside other instances of negotiated authority, this article demonstrates how ex-territorial arrangements in Israel serve not merely as practical responses to seemingly intractable conflicts, but as spaces where governance ambiguity becomes institutionalized. While these arrangements facilitate coexistence of competing claims, they simultaneously create regulatory vacuums where even basic safety considerations remain unaddressed. The Meron disaster thus illuminates not only the specific challenges of holy site management, but also the broader paradox of a modern state where the preservation of ambiguity has evolved into a characteristic mode of governance.",
